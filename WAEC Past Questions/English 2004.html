                    As a result, the search for oil is very expensive, and unless oil is found, there in <select id="sel81"><option>-81-</option><option value="a">A. useable</option><option value="b">B. saleable</option><option value="c">C. commercial</option><option value="d">D. practical</option></select>. quantities the companies or governments involved are liable to lose heavily.
